## COLLECTEUR 🎮💰

A fast-paced arcade game developed in **Lua/LÖVE2D**.

### 🎯 Objective

The goal of **COLLECTEUR** is simple: collect as many **good coins** (gold coins) as possible while avoiding the **bad coins** (red coins) at all costs. 
Keep your reflexes and see how many you can grab!

But watch out...

The more good coins you collect, the **bigger you grow** — which makes it harder to dodge (^w^)

### ✨ Features

- Easy-to-learn arcade gameplay
  
- Developed with **Lua** and the **LÖVE2D** framework
  

### ⬇️ Installation

To run COLLECTEUR, you need to have **LÖVE2D** installed on your machine.

```bash
# Download LÖVE2D (https://love2d.org/)

# Then run the game with the following command, using your project's folder path:

love C:\PATH
```

Replace `C:\PATH` with the actual folder path of the project.  
If you are inside the game folder, simply run:

```bash
love .
```
